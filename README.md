🚀 SurvivalVerse: Hunt for Glory  
A dynamic survival game where you fight, score, and evolve. Defeat enemies, and etch your legacy on the blockchain.

📌 Problem Statement  
Problem Statement 2 – Unleash Blockchain Play with Monad  

🎯 Objective  
SurvivalVerse is a real-time survival game built on Monad blockchain where players:
- Fight randomly spawned enemies with different health and behavior  
- Level up through score, triggering smart contract events to update player stats  
- Have their progress stored as permanent game history using blockchain
- The contract is setup through the player maximum levels and maximum orbs reached till now can also be fetched

🏁 Final Words
This game began as a sketch and evolved into a world — of chaos, code, and combat.
We fought bugs just like our player fights enemies. And every crash was just another respawn 💥
